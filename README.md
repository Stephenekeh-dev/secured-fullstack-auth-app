# 🔐 SecureAuth — Encrypted User Authentication System

SecureAuth is a **full-stack web application** designed to provide **robust and secure user authentication** using **Angular** (frontend), **Django & PostgreSQL** (backend), and **Blowfish encryption** for password protection.

## 🚀 Features

- 🐍 **Django 5.1.7 REST API** backend with PostgreSQL integration
